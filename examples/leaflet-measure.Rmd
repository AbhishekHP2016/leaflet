## Measuring coordinates, distances, and areas

You can use `addMeasure()` to add the [leaflet-measure](https://github.com/ljagis/leaflet-measure) plugin to a map.

```{r }
library(leaflet)

m <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()

m %>%
  # Central Park
  fitBounds(-73.9, 40.75, -73.95,40.8) %>%
  addMeasure()
```

Use various options to customize the appearance and behavior of the plugin (see `?addMeasure` for details).

```{r }
m %>%
  # Berlin, Germany
  fitBounds(13.76134, 52.675499, 13.0884, 52.33812) %>%
  addMeasure(
    position = "bottomleft",
    primaryLengthUnit = "meters",
    primaryAreaUnit = "sqmeters",
    activeColor = "#3D535D",
    completedColor = "#7D4479")
```
